Dear researcher,

The DIET and DICED dataset (‘Licensed Material’) are made available to the non-commerical and scientific communities for academic, teaching and scientific purposes. Permission is granted to you (‘the Licensee’) to use the dataset with these conditions. Please include a reference to the following published work:

Wai Y. K. San, Teng Zhang, Shaokang Chen, Arnold Wiliem, Dario Stefanelli, Brian C. Lovell. “Early Experience of Depth Estimation on Intricate Objects Using Generative Adversarial Networks.” Digital Imaging and Computing Techniques Australia (DICTA), 2018.

In this folder, you will find the full resolution, raw depth images from the light field camera together with the corresponding colour photos.

The folder is partitioned into the object classes where the depth image is listed as a number followed by the letter A and the colour photo listed as a number followed by the letter B. 

For inputting the images into deep learning algorithms the user may need to split the images to specific input patch size. 


Kind regards,

Wai Y. K. San
